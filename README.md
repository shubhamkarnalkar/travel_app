## Introduction

Travel App brings many benefits, both to the client: devices will need fewer requests, and therefore reduce data usage. And to the programmer: requests are arguable, they have the same structure as the request, since the ERP has inbuilt API structure, making a API development is simpler.

This project combines the benefits of Flutter, which is a framwork to build cross platform application such as Android, IOS, Web, Linux, and Windows.
